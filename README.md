# PersonalWebsite

I am creating a website to showcase myself.There are different sections that you can click on like About Me, Resume, Projects, Skills, Contact Me. There is also an slider that is more descriptive about some of the key points that I am most proud of. I also add the dark and light mode for user preference. I also have an professional picture of myself on the home page. I made sure that each page and hyperlink work as they are supposed to because web development can be confusing but is very helpful to be honest.
